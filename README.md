I'm an experienced web developer, developer advocate, and open-source project maintainer
with a passion for education. In my role as a software engineer, I thrive on challenge,
enjoy breaking down complex problems, and center user experience in my work.
I love to to mentor more junior developers as they grow in the industry, and I push
my teams to improve our processes and communication. I enjoy collaborating with product and
design teams early in the development process, and I can be relied on to translate complex
technical concepts into accessible language for any audience.<br><br>
        Education and community have been at the heart of many of my pursuits in the tech industry.
        While pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University, I served as a teaching
        assistant for introductory programming classes for my fellow grad students.
        As lead maintainer and developer of
        <a href="https://proto.school" target="_blank">ProtoSchool</a>,
        I built interactive coding tutorials on decentralized web protocols and nurtured
        the growth of learning communities around the globe.
        I'm also proud to have co-organized <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/camp" target="_blank">
          Offline Camp</a>, an unconference tech retreat that's building the
        <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/" target="_blank">Offline First</a> community, one
        campfire at a time. In past developer advocacy roles, I've helped my fellow coders
        succeed by creating beginner-friendly blog posts, tutorials, talks, and code
        samples on topics including Offline First and Progressive Web Apps.
